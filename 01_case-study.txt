Question:
-> How can you improve your communication and relationship with third-party software providers to stay informed 
about upcoming changes or updates?

Answer:
In my opinion and POV for improving the communication and relationship with third-party software 
providers to stay informed about upcoming changes or updates is to:
"Establish regular Meetings". 

For example, establishing regular meetings with third-party software providers facilitates ongoing communication
regarding upcoming changes or updates they plan to implement. These meetings also provide a platform for both 
parties to discuss matters regularly, preventing misunderstandings and chaos.
