Question:
Our IT company embarked on an ambitious project in January 2024 aimed at delivering a cutting-edge software solution to our users and clients.
The project was meticulously planned with a target launch date of June 1. However, as the deadline approaches, 
it becomes apparent that several tasks are still in progress,  and there are unresolved bugs that need attention. The testing process,
crucial for ensuring product quality, has not yet begun. 
As a software engineer involved in the project, what aspects could have been 
handled better to prevent the delays and issues experienced, such as incomplete tasks, unresolved bugs, 
and a delayed testing process?

Answer:
The following aspects that could have been handled better are:
    1. Detailed Planning
    2. Task Management
    3. Priorizations

These 3 aspects i think the most important aspects of a project because when you have a complete and detailed planning it can lead your
team to handle the project correctly and with a proper task management and priorizations your team can know what are the most important
one to do or the one that need an action imeediately.

Additionaly, for me the most important one is to implement an agile development methodology for flexibility in managing changes.
